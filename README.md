## AI Agent Collaboration Platform

**TeamForgeAI** is a platform designed for creating, managing, and collaborating with AI agents. Built using Streamlit, this application allows you to define agents with specific skills and expertise, and then engage them in a group chat setting to solve tasks collaboratively.

**Create Agents:**
- Use the sidebar to define new agents.
- Provide a name, description, select skills, and list tools for each agent.

**Organize Teams:**
- Create teams to group agents based on projects or tasks.
- Save agents into teams

**Start a Discussion:**
- Input your request or problem statement in the main input area, 'Enter your request.'
- The application will rephrase the request into an optimized prompt and automatically generate the agents to complete the task!
- Add any 'Additional Input' if you need to add to interject in the team's discussion

**Interact with Agents:**
- Click on an agent's button to trigger their response.
- Agents will communicate and collaborate within the discussion area.
- Customize each agent's settings.
- Refine the agent's prompts dynamically based on the Discussion History context.

**Skills:**

The skills are implemented using a 'sure-shot' method, guaranteeing they will trigger without relying solely on an AI prompt. The skills are assigned to an agent, effectively switching them into a sort of 'tools mode' that mandates that they use the tool as a programmatic response. This avoids issues often seen in group chat situations where an agent hallucinates and pretends to run the skill script. When you push the agent button in TeamForgeAI, the agent will always use the skill.
- 'Web Search' uses Serper and you must provide your API for this skill to function
- 'Fetch Web Content' reads the content of a web page into the conversation
- 'Generate SD Images' creates an image based on the conversation context

**Review and Download:**
- The discussion history is preserved for future reference.
- Download agent configurations and workflows as needed.
