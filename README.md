## AI Agent Collaboration Platform

**TeamForgeAI** is a platform designed for creating, managing, and collaborating with AI agents. Built using Streamlit, this application allows you to define agents with specific skills and expertise, and then engage them in a group chat setting to solve tasks collaboratively.

- **Project Goal, Objectives, and Deliverables:** Define and track your project's overall goal, specific objectives, and tangible deliverables.
- **Skill Integration:** Integrate custom Python skills to extend agent capabilities and automate tasks.
- **Web Search and Content Summarization:** Agents can perform web searches and summarize content from provided URLs.
- **Image Generation:** Generate images using Stable Diffusion, powered by the Automatic1111 API.
- **Interactive Discussion and Whiteboard:** Track agent interactions, share ideas, and store code snippets on a virtual whiteboard.
- **Downloadable Agent and Workflow Files:** Export agents and workflows as JSON files for use in AutoGen and CrewAI.
- **Team Management:** Create and manage teams of agents, allowing for flexible collaboration and organization.

## Usage

**Create Agents:**
- Use the sidebar to define new agents.
- Provide a name, description, select skills, and list tools for each agent.

**Organize Teams:**
- Create teams to group agents based on projects or tasks.
- Save agents into teams

**Start a Discussion:**
- Input your request or problem statement in the main input area, 'Enter your request.'
- The application will rephrase the request into an optimized prompt and automatically generate the agents to complete the task!
- Add any 'Additional Input' if you need to add to interject in the team's discussion

**Interact with Agents:**
- Click on an agent's button to trigger their response.
- Agents will communicate and collaborate within the discussion area.
- Customize each agent's settings.
- Refine the agent's prompts dynamically based on the Discussion History context.

**Skills:**

The skills are implemented using a 'sure-shot' method, guaranteeing they will trigger without relying solely on an AI prompt. The skills are assigned to an agent, effectively switching them into a sort of 'tools mode' that mandates that they use the tool as a programmatic response. This avoids issues often seen in group chat situations where an agent hallucinates and pretends to run the skill script. When you push the agent button in TeamForgeAI, the agent will always use the skill.
- 'Web Search' uses Serper, and you must provide your API for this skill to function
- 'Fetch Web Content' reads the content of a web page into the conversation
- 'Generate SD Images' creates an image based on the conversation context
- 'Project Management' empowers an agent with the ability to manage projects and provide status updates to the team.

TeamForgeAI supports custom Python skills that can be integrated into agents. To create a new skill:
1. Create a new Python file in the skills directory.
2. Define a function with the same name as the skill.
3. Add a docstring to describe the skill's functionality.
4. Save the file with a .py extension.
5. The skill will be automatically loaded and available for assignment to agents.

**Review and Download:**
- The discussion history is preserved for future reference.
- Download agent configurations and workflows as needed.

Examples: 
- Write a children's book: Request TeamForgeAI to create a children's book about a llama. Agents such as a "Children's Book Writer", "Illustrator", and "Language Specialist" will be generated to collaborate on the project.
- Develop a marketing plan: Ask TeamForgeAI to develop a marketing plan for a new product. Agents like a "Market Research Analyst", "Content Creator", and "Social Media Manager" will work together to create a comprehensive plan.
- Build a website: Request TeamForgeAI to build a website for your business. Agents such as a "Web Developer", "Designer", and "Content Writer" will collaborate to bring your website to life.
